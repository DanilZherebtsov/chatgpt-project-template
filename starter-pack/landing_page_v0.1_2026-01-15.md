## Problem Statement

Most people don’t quit learning because they’re lazy.

They quit because their plans are unrealistic.

They overestimate what they can do in a week, fall behind,
and then abandon the whole thing.

---

## Solution

The AI Study Planner helps you plan learning **around your real schedule**.

Instead of massive, abstract goals, it creates:
- Weekly study plans
- Based on your available time
- Adjusted as your week changes

No guilt. No restarting from zero.

---

## How It Works

1. You tell us what you want to learn
2. You connect your calendar
3. The AI generates a realistic weekly study plan
4. The plan adapts as your schedule changes

---
