## Why This Project Exists

I want to solve a problem I personally experience.

I start learning something new with good intentions, but my plans are always
too ambitious. I fall behind, miss a few days, and then abandon the whole thing.

The issue is not motivation.
The issue is unrealistic planning.

---

## Core Observation

People overestimate what they can do in a week and underestimate
how demotivating it feels to fall behind.

Most learning tools assume:

- unlimited energy
- predictable schedules
- perfect consistency

That is not how real life works, especially for working professionals.

---

## Early Hypothesis

If an AI could:

- understand how much time I *actually* have
- plan learning sessions around my real calendar
- adjust plans without “resetting progress”

Then people would study more consistently, even if progress is slow.

Consistency beats intensity.

## Who This Is For (Initial Thinking)

Primary:

- Busy professionals learning technical skills
- Career switchers studying evenings and weekends

Secondary:

- University students with irregular schedules

Explicitly not for:

- People preparing for one-off exams
- Hardcore productivity optimizers
- Gamification-driven learners

---

## What Makes This Different (So Far)

This is not a task manager.

This is not a productivity app.

The core promise is:
“Help me keep moving forward, even on bad weeks.”

Key differentiators (tentative):

- Calendar-aware study planning
- Weekly plans, not daily micro-optimizations
- No streaks, no guilt, no shame mechanics

---

## Rough Feature Ideas (Unvalidated)

- Weekly AI-generated study plan
- Time-block suggestions based on calendar gaps
- Ability to mark a week as “low energy”
- Daily adjustments without losing progress
- Simple progress visualization (weeks completed)

---

## Things I’m Unsure About

- Should this be mobile-first or desktop-first?
- How much automation is too much?
- Do users want AI suggestions, or control?
- Should pricing be low friction or premium?

These need validation.

---

## Constraints (Reality Check)

- v1 should be buildable by a small team or solo developer
- Avoid complex ML training in early versions
- Prefer simple heuristics + LLM prompts
- Privacy is critical — calendar data should be minimal

---

## Success Criteria (Early)

This product is successful if:

- Users return weekly
- People don’t abandon plans after a bad week
- The tool feels supportive, not demanding

---

## Open Questions

- How to explain this value simply on a landing page?
- How to measure “consistency” meaningfully?
- What’s the smallest version that proves the idea?

---

## Notes to Self

- Don’t overbuild early
- Avoid feature creep
- Keep the mental model simple
- Optimize for trust and calm, not excitement
