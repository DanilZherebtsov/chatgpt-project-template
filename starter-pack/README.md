*How to maintain*

## **Project first setup**

Export all documents in MD format and upload to ChatGPT project:

- AUTHORITATIVE_STATE.md and PROGRAM_CHANGELOG.md upload as is without adding a version or date to the file name.
- All other files must contain a version and export date in filename, e.g. Initial_curriculum_thoughts_v0.1_2025-12-19.md

## **Project update**

### **1. Evolutionary Knowledge**

- Inside each updated file change version in heading
- Update the Supersedes field
- Add a few lines in the Changelog at the top
- Export MD, add date, upload to Project
- When a file matures and older versions don’t make sense, delete them from project

### **2. Authoritative Knowledge**

- Reflect changes in `AUTHORITATIVE_STATE` and `PROGRAM_CHANGELOG`
- Export MD files, DON’T add date.
- Delete previous versions from project and upload new versions.

### **3. Notify via agent via chat**

> I’ve uploaded a new document - Mid-roll_ad_v0.1_2025-12-19.md. This replaces all previous Mid-roll_ad version. Use ONLY this version going forward.
